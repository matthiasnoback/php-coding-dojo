# FizzBuzz Kata

The FizzBuzz Kata requires you to produce a finite list of numbers, some of which are replaced by strings. The rules
are:

- A number divisible by three is replaced with ``'Fizz'``
- A number divisible by five is replaced with ``'Buzz'``
- A number divisible by three *and* five is replaced with ``'FizzBuzz'``

For example:

    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    16
    17
    Fizz
    19
    Buzz

Remember to take baby steps and write no more code than necessary to let one test pass.
